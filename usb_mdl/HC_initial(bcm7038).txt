1. Set broadcom register to let HC treat data in SDRAM as big endian.

    ulVal = BCHP_USB_CTRL_SETUP_BABO_MASK /* Big Endian Byte Order */
          | BCHP_USB_CTRL_SETUP_FNHW_MASK /* Big Endian 2Bytes Order */
          | BCHP_USB_CTRL_SETUP_IOC_MASK  /* InvertOverCurrent */
          ; 
    BCM_REG_WRITE( BCHP_USB_CTRL_SETUP, ulVal );
