// note :

1. Choose UncompressedDebugQIPH in MotorolaTvMonQiph.mcp. Otherwise, you cannot download code to SDRAM.

2. Since in bcm7400, I cannot find the disable RS232 transmit register like bcm7038, I Rewrite 2 RS232 output functions to disable print message during boot, but still will print a 'B' character on RS232. It's OK to communication with SIE (without leading character @ is fine). Print 'B' is came from UserBspCppInit() of BspUser.c.

3. Now, you can run station test by press keypad "UP", "LEFT", ..., during boot. Or Keypad select item on keypad by don't press keypad during boot.
