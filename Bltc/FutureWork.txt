Future Work:

1. Since in bcm7400, I cannot find the disable RS232 transmit register like bcm7038, I Rewrite 2 RS232 output functions to disable print message during boot, but still will print a 'B' character on RS232. It OK to communication with SIE (without leading character @ is fine). Print 'B' is came from UserBspCppInit() of BspUser.c.

2.
int bltc_main()
{
	lib.led.Init();	// I don't know why ? Need this or lib.led._hLed will be null
	ui = UserInterfaceSelect();
	ui->Run();
	
	return 0;
}
